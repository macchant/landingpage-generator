## 🧐 What is this?

**Prompt Architect** is a single-file GUI tool designed to solve the "Quality Ceiling" problem when working with AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).

When you ask an AI to "make a website," it defaults to generic styles, uses Lorem Ipsum, and often skips complex logic. This tool generates a **Master System Prompt** that forces the AI to:
1.  **Commit to a specific aesthetic** (e.g., "Swiss Minimal" or "Cyberpunk").
2.  **Adhere to a strict tech stack** (Tailwind, GSAP, Vanilla JS).
3.  **Include mandatory sections** (preventing incomplete outputs).
4.  **Adopt a Senior Developer persona.**

## 🚀 Features

* **3 Core Archetypes:** Choose between Visual (High-end), SaaS (Functional), or Micro-Tool (Logic-heavy).
* **Aesthetic Selector:** Narrow down the design DNA before a single line of code is written.
* **Mandatory Checklist:** Explicitly tell the AI which components (Hero, Pricing, Footer) cannot be skipped.
* **One-Click Copy:** Generates a pre-formatted prompt ready to paste into a new chat session.
* **No Build Step:** Built with vanilla HTML/JS and Tailwind CDN. Just open and run.

## 📦 How to Use
